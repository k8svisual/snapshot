            <p>VpK (Visual parsed Kubernetes) Snapshot retrieves information from a kubernetes (k8s) instance and
                creates a snapshot
                directory with a separate file for each unique k8s resource. The k8s resource type must support the
                <b>get</b>
                verb to be included in the snapshot.
            </p>

                    snapshot directory that is created in the output root directory. The default value will be replaced
                    with this value if provided. <br>Example directory name:
